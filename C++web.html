        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. As the foundation of web development, HTML provides the structure and semantics necessary to define the elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. By using a combination of tags and attributes, developers can create well-organized and accessible web content that can be displayed across different devices and browsers. Whether you're creating a simple static website or a complex web application, HTML serves as the building blocks for designing and publishing content on the internet.</p>
        <h1>Key Features</h1>
        <li>Defines the structure of web documents using elements like <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, etc.</li>
  
        <li>Uses tags to specify headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, and other content elements</li>
